# Simple WSJF Calculator Power-Up for Trello

Hey there 

Many organizations following Scaled Agile Framework use Trello a roadmapping tool. This power-up adds a WSJF calculator to your roadmap cards so you and your team can quickly calculate each card's WSJF. 

Here's how to add the WSJF Calculator to your boards:

t's a little clunky right now, but I'll give you step-by-step instructions. First, Trello wants to make this public power-up. They've done an awesome code review (best code review I've gotten received). As soon as I get time to apply all of their recommendations (God knows when), this will be a lot easier. 

In the meantime, here's what you need to do:
 
If your board isn't in a Team, create a Team and move your WSJF board(s) to that team. 
Navigate to https://trello.com/power-ups/admin
Click on the Team 
Click Create a Power-Up button
Fill out the form using the information in the screen shots below
For convenience, here are the URLs to paste into the appropriate section:

Click Done to save the power-up.
Click Go to Your Boards
Click the board you added to the Team
Click Show Menu
Click Power-Ups
Click Custom in the left nav
Find the WSJF power-up tile
Click Enable
Click X in upper, right-hand corner of Power-Ups manager modal
You're done! Start scoring.
